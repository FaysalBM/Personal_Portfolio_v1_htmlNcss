# Faysal Badaoui Mahdad Personal Portfolio

This project is my portfolio, made completly by me in React.js and three.js.
Also, the 3D models were modeled by me in Cinema 4d

This project was made to learn and improve my capablilities for web developing.
The website code Is free to use for any project. 

An important point Is that the node_modules where all the libraries are installed isn't uplodaded, so If you want it, contact me and I'm gonna try to get it to you.
